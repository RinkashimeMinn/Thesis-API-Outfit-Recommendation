This project implements a content-based outfit recommendation system using a Siamese Neural Network and contextual event prediction.

The system encodes user inputs (event type, preferences, and context) and outfit attributes into numerical feature vectors. A Siamese Neural Network learns a similarity function that measures how well an outfit matches a given user context. Outfits are ranked based on similarity scores, and the top-N results are returned as recommendations.
